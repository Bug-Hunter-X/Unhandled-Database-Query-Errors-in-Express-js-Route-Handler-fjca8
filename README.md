# Unhandled Database Query Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to handle potential errors during database queries within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem

The original code directly uses the user input from the request parameter without any error handling for the database operation. A failed database query results in an unexpected crash or a generic 500 Internal Server Error instead of an appropriate error response (like a 404). 

## Solution

The solution incorporates `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during the database query.  The improved code gracefully manages exceptions, providing informative error messages to both the client and server. This ensures resilience and improved user experience.
